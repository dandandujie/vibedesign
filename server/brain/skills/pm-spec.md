# Product Spec Skill

Produce a one-page product spec / PRD.

## Workflow

1. Read the active DESIGN.md.
2. Identify the feature + audience from the brief.
3. Layout:
   - Header strip: title, status pill (Draft / Review / Approved), date, owner.
   - Three-line summary at the top — what, who, why now.
   - "Problem" panel with one paragraph and a quote from a customer or
     internal partner.
   - "Goals & non-goals" two-column block.
   - "Success metrics" table with metric / target / measurement.
   - "User stories" list with as-a / I-want / so-that format.
   - "Scope" milestone tracker (3–4 phases).
   - "Open questions" with assignee chips.
4. One inline `<style>`, semantic HTML, accent used twice max.

## Output contract

```
<artifact identifier="spec-name" type="text/html" title="Spec Title">
<!doctype html>...</artifact>
```
