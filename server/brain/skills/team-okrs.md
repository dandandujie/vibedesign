# Team OKRs Skill

Produce a single-screen OKR tracker.

## Workflow

1. Read DESIGN.md.
2. Layout:
   - Quarter banner: Q4 FY25, dates, overall progress chip.
   - Three objective cards. Each has:
     - Objective title + owner avatar + status pill (On track / At risk / Off track)
     - 3 key results, each a row with metric / current → target / progress bar
   - Right sidebar: at-a-glance KPIs, top movers, blockers callout.
3. Clear progress visualisation, calm palette, one accent.

## Output contract

```
<artifact identifier="okr-q4" type="text/html" title="OKRs Q4">
<!doctype html>...</artifact>
```
